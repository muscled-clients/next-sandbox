A ready-to-go starter for creating Single Page Applications with React, Next.js, Typescript and Tailwind.css

Readily configured to purge unneeded tailwind styles when building for production.

Fully supports the PWA standard and installs a service worker when conditions are met.

Scores 100 in every lighthouse audit.

Preconfigured to be deployed to Zeit Now (also with PWA support there!)

Have fun!
